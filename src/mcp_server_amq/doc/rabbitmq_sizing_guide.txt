 You can choose the broker instance type that best supports your application. When choosing an instance type, it is important to consider factors that will affect broker performance:

    the number of clients and queues

    the volume of messages sent

    messages kept in memory

    redundant messages

Smaller broker instance types (t3.micro) are recommended only for testing application performance. We recommend larger broker instance types (m5.large and above) for production levels of clients and queues, high throughput, messages in memory, and redundant messages.

It is important to test your brokers to determine the appropriate instance type and size for your workload messaging requirements. Use the following sizing guidelines to determine the best appropriate instance type for your application.
Sizing guidelines for single instance deployment

The following table shows the maximum limit values for each instance type for single instance brokers.
Instance Type 	Connections 	Channels 	Queues 	Consumers per channel 	Shovels
t3.micro 	500 	1,500 	2,500 	1,000 	150
m5.large 	5,000 	15,000 	30,000 	1,000 	250
m5.xlarge 	10,000 	30,000 	60,000 	1,000 	500
m5.2xlarge 	20,000 	60,000 	120,000 	1,000 	1,000
m5.4xlarge 	40,000 	120,000 	240,000 	1,000 	2,000
Sizing guidelines for cluster deployment

The following table shows the maximum limit values for each instance type for cluster brokers.
Instance Type 	Queues 	Consumers per channel 	Shovels
m5.large 	10,000 	1,000 	150
m5.xlarge 	15,000 	1,000 	300
m5.2xlarge 	20,000 	1,000 	600
m5.4xlarge 	30,000 	1,000 	1200

The following connection and channel limits are applied per node:
Instance Type 	Connections 	Channels
m5.large 	500 	15,000
m5.xlarge 	10,000 	30,000
m5.2xlarge 	20,000 	60,000
m5.4xlarge 	40,000 	120,000

The exact limit values for a cluster broker may be lower than the indicated value depending on the number of available nodes and how RabbitMQ distributes resources among the available nodes. If you exceed the limit values, you can create a new connection to a different node and try again, or you can upgrade the instance size to increase the maximum limits
Error messages

The following error messages are returned when limits are exceeded. All values are based on the m5.large single instance limits.
Note

The error codes for the following messages may change based on the client library you are using.

Connection

ConnectionClosedByBroker 500 "NOT_ALLOWED - connection refused: node connection limit (500) is reached"

Channel

ConnectionClosedByBroker 1500 "NOT_ALLOWED - number of channels opened on node 'rabbit@ip-10-0-23-173.us-west-2.compute.internal' has reached the maximum allowed limit of (15,000)"

Consumer

ConnectionClosedByBroker: (530, 'NOT_ALLOWED - reached maximum (1,000) of consumers per channel')

Note

The following error messages use the HTTP Management API format.

Queue

{"error":"bad_request","reason":"cannot declare queue 'my_queue': queue limit in cluster (30,000) is reached"}]

Shovel

{"error":"bad_request","reason":"Validation failed\n\ncomponent shovel is limited to 250 per node\n"}

Vhost

{"error":"bad_request","reason":"cannot create vhost 'my_vhost': vhost limit of 4,000 is reached"}
